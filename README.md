# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

We were provided the code for most of the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb file and all of the code for the TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py files. I was responsible for providing the code for the pseudocode (also provided to us already) in the Q-training algorithm section. This code consisted of a Q-learning algorithm that trained the pirate (agent) to find the treasure (the end of the maze.)

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, it is my responsiblity to determine the clients' needs and objectives. Any knowledge transfers between me and the client would also need to occur. At that point, I would take the information they have provided, my own knowledge, and the tools provided by my employer to start on the software needed.
